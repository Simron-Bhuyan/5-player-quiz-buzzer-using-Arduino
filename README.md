On pressing any one of the 5 buttons :

`Button 1` => `RED`

`Button 2` => `YELLOW`

`Button 3` => `GREEN`

`Button 4` => `BLUE`

`Button 5` => `WHITE`
 
 
the selected button leads to its corresponding LED to start blinking and the Piezo Buzzer starts buzzing `(making sound)` 
 
 #NOTE: No other LEDs work until the current LED has finished blinking
